summary: "Today we'll define web accessibility, look at the legislation around it, and talk about strategies for incorporating accessibility in a team strategy, both retroactively (remediation) and moving forward (KPIs). In the second half, we'll focus on accessibility in code, and the special challenges your team is tackling."

        <h2>Toronto Homeless Memorial</h2>
        <p>Started by activist <a href="https://nowtoronto.com/news/remembering-toronto-housing-activist-bonnie-briggs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bonnie Briggs<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> a few decades back, the Toronto Homeless Memorial is a public service, held on the second Tuesday of each month at noon outside the south door of the Church of the Holy Trinity (<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@43.6545422,-79.3820436,20z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">map<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> - and yes, it's surrounded by the Eaton Centre).</p>
        <p>The service includes adding the names of the newly deceased to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Homeless_Memorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">memorial itself<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>.</p>
        <p>You can donate to the Memorial through the Church, but from what I can tell, it's appreciated as much or more if you simply attend in person or through their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/holytrinityTO/live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">facebook live stream<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>.</p>
        <p>The Memorial is currently lead by Rev. Pamela Trondson. She is a really lovely, approachable person. She first lead the service in December, 2021. That month, 34 names were added. I'm sure she'll answer any questions you have about the Memorial if you <a href="https://holytrinity.to/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact her through the Church<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a>.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Check in with the funeral director/officiant so you know
                <ul>
                    <li>where/when to go, and </li>
                    <li>if someone else will also be speaking.</li>
                    <li>(If so, you might want to check in with them, too.)</li>

            <li>Ask someone to read it over ahead of time</li>

            <li>Gently acknowledge how everyone is doing</li>
            <li>Maybe tell a joke (easiest laughs you’ll ever get?)</li>
            <li>decline - if you don’t have the resources to do this, it is absolutely okay to say so ahead of time</li>
            <li>completely fucking bail at the last second</li>

        <h2>Appendix 1: Failed Lecture Topics</h2>
        <p>I spent months figuring out what I wanted to talk about. I had a lot of bad ideas for lectures, and, since I think failure is interesting, I thought I'd put a few of them here:</p>
        <h3>This city hates you</h3>
        <p>Let's take over a small city. Cambridge Ontario, pop 140k, has mayoral elections decided by <2000 votes. This is about the capacity of the Danforth City Music Hall. Typically, DIY shipping container homes Ontario cost around $130 – $175 per sq ft. Those of us who work remotely can (possibly building our own ISP), the rest of us will grow high-margin crops, and produce value-added goods - black garlic cream cheese, lavender ice cream, pickled microgreens. But you know what they say, when the gold rush starts, sell shovels, so we should be oh fuck I hate this I hate this so much.</p>
        <h3>Linda Ronstadt is a fucking Queen who deserves a moment oh wait I just heard her on The Last of Us I guess it's happening</h3>
        <p>Go listen to Canciones de Mi Padre, it's a damn masterpiece.</p>
        <h3>The 20hz messageboard</h3>
        <p>...and other things facebook killed (posters, zines, show photography, small blogs, etc) (possibility of shift towards discord / mastodon?)</p>
        <h3>Defang the Police: TWO UNRELATED tv shows where ENTIRE PREMISE is that the Toronto Police team up with a fucking vampire.</h3>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forever_Knight" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forever Knight<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> (1992-1996) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Ties_(TV_series)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blood Ties<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a> (2007-2008). Weird, right?</p>
        <h3>Sundowning, pre-industrial sleep patterns and their impact on "witch crazes".</h3>
        <p>I couldn't prove any of this when I took "Witchcraft" at U of T, and I certainly can't prove it now.</p>
        <h3>The FBI's <a href="https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/stories/2009/april/highwayserial_040609" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Highway Serial Killings Initiative<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new window</span></a></h3>
        <p>Truck driving has been characterized as the ideal profession for a serial killer, with the FBI going so far as to form task force specifically to track them. Are they all "lone wolves"? Or is there an underground society of... nope, I don't want to do true crime. Just nah.</p>
        <h3>Forgotten relics of gritty Canadian youth programming in the mid-90s</h3>
        <p>Little Criminals, Straight Up, Liberty Street, the Odyssey, Jonovision, Twitch City. (Was this a legacy product of the Toronto New Wave filmmaking movement?) I&hellip; just really liked these shows.</p>
