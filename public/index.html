I had a lot of bad ideas for lectures, and, since I think failure is interesting, I thought I'd put a few of them here:</p><h3>This city hates you</h3><p>Let's take over a small city. Cambridge, Ontario, pop 140k, has mayoral elections decided by <2000 votes. This is roughly the capacity of the Danforth City Music Hall. Think of how few people we'd need to wrangle to be able to sway the fortunes of any city or town that's smaller than that.</p><p>Typically, DIY shipping container homes Ontario cost around <a href="https://www.containeraddict.com/building-shipping-container-homes-ontario-canada/#:~:text=Typically%2C%20DIY%20shipping%20container%20homes,%24200%20%E2%80%93%20%24300%20per%20sq%20ft." target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">$130 – $175 per sq ft<span class=show-for-sr> Opens in a new window</span></a>. Those of us who work remotely can do so (possibly <a href=https://www.wired.com/story/this-man-built-his-own-isp-26-million-dollar-funds/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">building our own ISP<span class=show-for-sr> Opens in a new window</span></a>), the rest of us will grow high-margin crops, and produce value-added goods - black garlic cream cheese, lavender ice cream, pickled microgreens, just off the top of my head. But you know what they say, when the gold rush starts, sell shovels, so we should be oh fuck I hate this I hate this so much.</p><h3>Linda Ronstadt is a fucking Queen who deserves a moment oh wait I just heard her on The Last of Us I guess it's happening</h3><p>Go listen to <a href=https://www.discogs.com/release/1518337-Linda-Ronstadt-Canciones-De-Mi-Padre target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Canciones de Mi Padre<span class=show-for-sr> Opens in a new window</span></a>, it's a damn masterpiece.</p><h3>The 20hz messageboard / Stillepost</h3><p>...and other <a href=https://medium.com/@WestEndMatt/id-like-to-tell-you-about-secret-arcade-20hz-and-stillepost-928cd111efbe target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Toronto Music Scene things<span class=show-for-sr> Opens in a new window</span></a> facebook killed (posters, zines, show photography, small blogs, etc) (possibility of shift towards discord / mastodon?)</p><h3>Defang the Police: TWO UNRELATED tv shows where ENTIRE PREMISE is that the Toronto Police team up with a fucking vampire.</h3><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forever_Knight target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Forever Knight<span class=show-for-sr> Opens in a new window</span></a> (1992-1996) and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Ties_(TV_series) target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Blood Ties<span class=show-for-sr> Opens in a new window</span></a> (2007-2008). Weird, right?</p><h3>AC/DC: Bisexual band or <em>the most</em> bisexual band?</h3><h3>Sundowning, pre-industrial sleep patterns and their impact on "witch crazes".</h3><p>I couldn't prove any of this when I took "Witchcraft" at U of T, and I certainly can't prove it now.</p><h3>The FBI's Highway Serial Killings Initiative</h3><p>Truck driving has been characterized as the ideal profession for a serial killer, with the FBI going so far as to <a href=https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/stories/2009/april/highwayserial_040609 target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">form a task force specifically to track them<span class=show-for-sr> Opens in a new window</span></a>. Are they all "lone wolves"? Or is there an underground society of... nope, I don't want to do true crime. Just nah.</p><h3>Forgotten relics of gritty Canadian youth programming in the mid-90s</h3><p>Little Criminals, Straight Up, Liberty Street, the Odyssey, Jonovision, Twitch City. (Was this a legacy product of the Toronto New Wave filmmaking movement?) I&mldr; just really liked these shows.</p><h3>Odd birds of the Upper Ottawa Valley</h3><p>Originally inspired by this <a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/Cks0MJ1AH1I/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">killer canada.gov.ca post<span class=show-for-sr> Opens in a new window</span></a> (aren't they all, though?), I wanted to speak to some of the very odd characters I knew, or heard tell of, growing up in the Upper Ottawa Valley. It's a strange, witchy place (seriously, there are witches), now increasingly populated by Mennonite families who <em>wish</em> they were throwing it back as hard as some of the 4th-generation farmers, Holy Well wishers, off-grid draft dodgers on pirate radio, and all the Beach Kids with accents thicker and stickier than biker hash.</p><p>But time travel is more art than science, and I got scared off this one. I did get some beautiful letters from my mom about some of the sweet oddball bachelors, refugees from the lumber sleighs, and a book about the Roma peoples who rode around in caravans. Also, a book about the last hanging in Renfrew County (in the 1950s!) but <a href=https://www.abebooks.com/9780968010600/Reasonable-Doubt-Last-Hanging-Refrew-0968010601/plp target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">the cover's so gruesome<span class=show-for-sr> Opens in a new window</span></a>, even (especially?) in black & white, I have it wrapped in brown craft paper. I didn't have the heart to ask my wonderful High School World Religions teacher if he's related to the guy on the cover (he definitely is).</p></section><div class=body-spacer></div></main></body></html>
